Sneakybass is a sample library for Plogue Sforzando version 1.973 or newer. It contains samples of a 1958 Otto Rubner double bass played and mapped by Drogomir Smolken, played pizzicato and very quietly. Think sneaky late night practice.

Fifths tuning (CGDA), Thomastik-Infeld Spirocore strings.

To register the Sforzando bank, drag the Sneakybass.bank.xml file onto the Sforzando interface. Once registered, the instrument will be available in the Sforzando loading menu and the GUI will work.
